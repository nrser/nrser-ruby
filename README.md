# NRSER Ruby lib

basic ruby utils i use in a lot of stuff.

these tools are hastily written or copied from other sources. 

they are not fast.

they are not optimized.

they are largely untested.

proceed with caution.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'nrser'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nrser
