module NRSER::RSpex::ExampleGroup
  
  # HACK HACK HACK-ITY HACK - Allow for overriding RSpec methods
  # 
  # Yeah, it has to do with mixin mixing-in ordering - seems to be that when
  # 
  #     config.extend NRSER::RSpex::ExampleGroup
  # 
  # {NRSER::RSpex::ExampleGroup} gets mixed in *very early* in the chain,
  # before {RSpec::Core::ExampleGroup}... why you would provide an explicit
  # extension mechanism and not give those extensions priority I'm not sure,
  # but I'm sure I shouldn't be looking into it right now, so here we are:
  # 
  # It turns out that {NRSER::RSpex::Example}, which gets mixed with
  # 
  #     config.include NRSER::RSpex::Example
  # 
  # gets mixed *last*, so by using it's {NRSER::RSpex::Example.included}
  # hook we can use
  # 
  #   base#extend NRSER::RSpex::ExampleGroup::Overrides
  # 
  # to mix these guys over the top of RSpec's methods.
  # 
  # Seems like we could just mix all of {NRSER::RSpex::ExampleGroup} there
  # to get the behavior I would have expected all along, but maybe it's better
  # to have these explicit notes for the moment and not change much else until
  # I get the chance to really check out what's going on.
  # 
  # And really it's all to override `.described_class` to pick up our
  # metadata if it's there, but that approach is in quite a bit of use at
  # this point, and, no, I have no idea how it seemed to work up until this
  # point :/
  # 
  module Overrides
    
    # Override {RSpec::Core::ExampleGroup.described_class} to use RSpex's
    # `:class` metadata if it's present.
    # 
    # Because I can't figure out how to feed RSpec the described class
    # without it being the description, and we want better descriptions.
    # 
    # Some hackery could def do it, this is RUBY after all, but whatever this
    # works for now and may even be less fragile.
    # 
    # @return [Class]
    #   If there's a `:class` in the metadata, or if RSpec has on through the
    #   standard means (`describe MyClass do ...`).
    # 
    # @return [nil]
    #   If we don't have a class context around.
