module NRSER
  
  # A class to hold info about how to find a record (besides by primary key).
  # 
  # Needs to support "template/placeholder"-type information - instructions
  # about *how* to find the values to match against depending on a source
  # object available later.
  # 
  # @todo
  #   Not sure if this is the best name... there's already
  #   {NRSER::Types::Where}...
  #   
  #   Maybe this functionality has something to do with the types system?
  #   It seems like the placeholder stuff would be hard to integrate with 
  #   that, but having a whole other very similar system sucks too.
