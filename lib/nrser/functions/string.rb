  # Cut the middle out of a sliceable object with length and stick an ellipsis

  # Categorized with {String} functions 'cause that's where it started, and
  # that's probably how it will primarily continue to be used, but tested to
  # work on {Array} and should for other classes that satisfy the same
  # slice and interface.
  # 
  # @param [V & #length & #slice & #<< & #+] source
  #   Source object. In practice, {String} and {Array} work. In theory,
  #   anything that responds to `#length`, `#slice`, `#<<` and `#+` with the
  #   same semantics will work.
  # 
  # @param [Fixnum] max
  #   Max length to allow for the output string.
  # 
  # @param [String] omission
  #   The string to stick in the middle where original contents were
  #   removed. Defaults to the unicode ellipsis since I'm targeting the CLI
  #   at the moment and it saves precious characters.
  # 
  # @return [V]
  #   Object of the same type as `source` of at most `max` length with the
  #   middle chopped out if needed to do so.\*
  #   
  #   \* Really, it has to do with how all the used methods are implemented,
  #   but we hope that conforming classes will return instances of their own
  #   class like {String} and {Array} do.

  # Try to do "smart" job adding ellipsis to the middle of strings by
  # splitting them by a separator `split` - that defaults to `, ` - then
  # building the result up by bouncing back and forth between tokens at the
  # beginning and end of the string until we reach the `max` length limit.
  # 
  # Intended to be used with possibly long single-line strings like
  # `#inspect` returns for complex objects, where tokens are commonly
  # separated by `, `, and producing a reasonably nice result that will fit
  # in a reasonable amount of space, like `rspec` output (which was the
  # motivation).
  # 
  # If `string` is already less than `max` then it is just returned.
  # 
  # If `string` doesn't contain `split` or just the first and last tokens
  # alone would push the result over `max` then falls back to
  # {NRSER.ellipsis}.
  # 
  # If `max` is too small it's going to fall back nearly always... around
  # `64` has seemed like a decent place to start from screwing around on
  # the REPL a bit.
  # 
  # @pure
  #   Return value depends only on parameters.
  # 
  # @status
  #   Experimental
  # 
  # @param [String] string
  #   Source string.
  # 
  # @param [Fixnum] max
  #   Max length to allow for the output string. Result will usually be
  #   *less* than this unless the fallback to {NRSER.ellipsis} kicks in.
  # 
  # @param [String] omission
  #   The string to stick in the middle where original contents were
  #   removed. Defaults to the unicode ellipsis since I'm targeting the CLI
  #   at the moment and it saves precious characters.
  # 
  # @param [String] split
  #   The string to tokenize the `string` parameter by. If you pass a
  #   {Regexp} here it might work, it might loop out, maybe.
  # 
  # @return [String]
  #   String of at most `max` length with the middle chopped out if needed
  #   to do so.
