# Namespace for new ideas I'm trying out. Totally unstable. May be gone
# completely tomorrow, etc.
# 
# While, yes, the entire package is alpha, and there is no guarantee against
# change and breakage, I'm generally at a point where I'm trying to keep
# things that work mostly working.
# 
# Stuff in here has no such consideration.
# 
# There may be some tests for it, but they are going to be skipped by default
# and certainly won't prevent releases, if they're even run at all.
