# Adaptation of {SemanticLogger::Loggable} mixin to use {NRSER::Log::Logger}
# instances from {NRSER::Log.[]}.
# 
# Like {SemanticLogger::Loggable} adds class and instance `logger` and
# `logger=` methods that create loggers on demand and store them in the
# `@semantic_logger` instance variables.

  # Gets the {NRSER::Log:Logger} for use in the instance. This will be the
  # class logger from {ClassMethods#logger} unless the instance has a
  # `#create_logger` method.
  # 
  # The `#create_logger` method is expected to return a {NRSER::Log::Logger}
  # instance, which will be saved in the `@semantic_logger` instance variable
  # for future use.
  # 
  # That method does not need to return a different logger for every instance
  # - if you just want to have a different logger for *all* instance with a
  # different level or formatter or whatever, you can save it somewhere else
  # and always return that same instance.
  # 
  # If you are dealing with frozen instances make sure to call `#logger` before
  # you freeze (likely in the constructor). If you don't want to save the
  # logger at all, just override this method itself.
  # 
  # This is a departure from {SemanticLogger::Loggable} that started because
  # if the instance is frozen then attempting to set `@semantic_logger` will
  # raise an error.
  # 
  # I also started ending up with classes that wanted to individually
  # configure their loggers, so it seemed like we could take out two birds
  # with this stone.
  # 
  # @return [SemanticLogger::Logger]
  #   Instance level logger, if {ClassMethods.instance_logger?},
  #   otherwise the class level logger from {ClassMethods#logger}.
