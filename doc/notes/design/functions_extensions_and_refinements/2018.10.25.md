Functions, Extensions and Refinements II (2018.10.25 Design Notes)
==============================================================================

I'm now thinking that the `#be_a` that extends individual objects is kind shit.
It sucks to do something like check an object's type and have it come back with
new methods.

What I really want is Go-style (to my understanding) binding where methods that
take that class or interface as their first argument are callable like instance
methods. And it's Ruby. So it seems like there is quite possibly *some* way of
achieving something relatively similar. Though I would also like to avoid a 
large amount of magic fuckery behind the scenes.

New idea: Bind ext module methods individually in libraries and then call them.

This avoids modifying anything:

```Ruby
NRSER::Ext::Enumerable.
  instance_method( :count_by ).
  bind( [1, 2, :three, 'four', 5, :six] ).
  call &:class
=> {Fixnum=>3, Symbol=>2, String=>1}
```

Ok, that's nice, but it needs the shit compacted out of it...

```Ruby
class Object
  def n_x_find method_name
    method_name = method_name.to_sym unless method_name.is_a?( Symbol )

    singleton_class.ancestors.each do |cls|
      next unless cls.name && NRSER::Ext.const_defined?( cls.name )

      const = NRSER::Ext.const_get cls.name
      next unless const.is_a?( Module )

      next unless const.instance_methods.include? method_name

      return const.instance_method( method_name )
    end

    raise NameError,
          "Couldn't find #{ method_name } for #{ self }:#{ self.class }"
  end


  def n_x_call name, *args, &block
    n_x_find( name ).bind( self ).call *args, &block
  end


  def n_x
    NRSER::Meta::MethodMissingForwarder.new do |name, *args, &block|
      n_x_call name, *args, &block
    end
  end
end

[1, 2, :three, 'four', 5, :six].n_x.count_by, &:class

[1, 2, :three, 'four', 5, :six].n_x.count_by, &:class
```

Wow... that kind of seems to work. It could of course also do some requiring
of files, but it's kinda cool that it only works with what's been required,
sticking to that same paradigm *and* reducing the amount of overhead.

So... it seems:

1.  Reasonably concise and convenient.
2.  Zero monkey-impact.

Which is great. The problems:

1.  Performance impact...? Has that lookup, and probably screws up whatever
    method caches and shit, allocates extra objects, etc. Caching will get into
    the whole "anything can be mutated at any time" mess to stay "correct".

2.  Extensibility? I guess what ever is added to `NRSER::Ext` will become 
    available there..?

3.  Binding is by name now... but the ext modules could have the class or module
    they bind to attached and checked.

4.  How does this work with like `&:ext_meth`, one of the problems I ran into
    with refinements?

    ```Ruby
    stuff.map &:count_by

    stuff.map &n_x_method( :count_by ) # Some shit like this..?
    ```
