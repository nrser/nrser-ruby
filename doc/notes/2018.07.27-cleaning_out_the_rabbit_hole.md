Cleaning Out The Rabbit Hole - 2018.07.27
==============================================================================

I'm inspired to write some things down as I start to slog down deeper down the
dark...

There is some good stuff in here. There is too much mediocre stuff, and too much
stuff in general; I forget that I had ever written things that are in here
somewhere, and usually don't discover them again until I finally get fed up with
whatever problem and dive in to finally fix... only to find I'd already
half-arsed it once and never really ended up using it much.

Basically, things need to be cleaned up into a few tight, useful, memorable
pieces.

What's good:

1.  Types. Becoming more and more useful.
2.  Props. Which are an extension of types. I like this shit.
3.  RSpex. Still has a *ways* to (slowly) go, but it helps.


And now to start the notes on sht that should change.

1.  Some enhanced containers that can be easily customizable and smarter about
    how they handle common situations (like "I don't want anything going into
    here to clobber anything else).

    This can probably cut out a lot of strewn-about code. See {.assoc_to}.

2.
